# 🎨 Tomasz: Code as Expression, Ethereum as Canvas

**I build trustless systems that speak — through design, code, and purpose.**

I'm not just coding decentralized apps; I'm shaping digital spaces where ownership feels personal, coordination feels elegant, and trust is rebuilt through transparency. Ethereum is my medium, and smart contracts are my brush.
